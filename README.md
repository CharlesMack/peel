### **About the Project**

Peel is the successor to our classic "Merk" project. While Merk focused on a minimalist, foundational approach, Peel embraces customization and advanced features to meet the demands of modern digital workflows. It's built as a full-featured, local-storage-powered application that rivals dedicated mobile apps and professional DIT carts. Peel empowers users to explore and master techniques from advanced lens control to multi-camera synchronization, making it a complete solution for creative capture.

### **Key Features**

* **Customizable Lens Control:** Go beyond static primes. Peel features a powerful focal length slider that allows you to simulate a wide range of lenses, from a wide-angle **16mm** to a super-telephoto **200mm**. This gives you unparalleled control over perspective and composition.
* **Advanced Color and Look Profiles:** The platform offers a rich library of pre-set looks and provides the ability to upload custom `.cube` **LUTs** (Lookup Tables), giving you total control over the color science and aesthetic of your footage.
* **Realistic Lens Effects:** A fully functional **ND filter slider** provides a realistic optical density effect for managing exposure. The **anamorphic de-squeeze** feature correctly displays your widescreen footage, complemented by a signature horizontal lens flare.
* **Simulated Multi-Cam Sync:** A unique and innovative feature that allows you to connect multiple instances of the app to a single session. This simulates a real-world multi-camera shoot, with synchronized recording capabilities, helping you practice complex collaborative workflows.
* **Persistent Local Storage:** All of your custom settings, from your chosen lens to your color profile, are automatically saved to your browser's local storage. This ensures a consistent and seamless experience every time you open the app.
